                        <br><br>
                        This <strong>Temporarily Closed</strong> Castle is a sight to behold with its primarily lush garden and side attraction castle.
                         On the castle premis there are also graves and old homes from the 16th century. 
                         The garden is very well maintaned as such the design is truly exquisite.

                        <b>Shakin' Brig of Edzell</b>
                        <br><br>
                        This<strong> possibly closed</strong> shaking bridge was built around 1900, it is part of the pathway to the blue door walk. 
                        It is quite exciting to jusmp on it since there is a feeling that it could fall apart,
                        which would be the case normally however due to storm Babet the bridge was damaged as such there is no news on if the bridge is functional.

                        One of the most beautiful walks around the area, with its 90-120 minute walk, it should suffice for most people,
                        although the parking spaces at the front are a bit limited, there is a road or even car park further up which will suffice.
                        Loved by locals so you will love it too.
