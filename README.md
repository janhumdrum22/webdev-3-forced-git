Overall it went alright i would say since it took about 5 days, ignoring the 1st 3 commit descriptions as they were me being frustrated at not knowing to use " cd webdev-3-forced-git " (i cant remember if this is covered in the week 1 pre-tutorial) and working till 3am even though that day was long and active for me.
My friend told me this would take about 30-40 hours and i thought, no way, but seeing as i spent most days working on this, i can definitively say yup, it took at least 40 hours to make the pages, so i have a new found respect for web developers as doing stuff here is incredibly finicky.
so the first 4 commits past the initialization of the git hub repository were me making the homepage with the manual nav bar, which then after consulting it with a friend on monday, i learned that it needed to be bootstrap so that was changed immediately, but thankfully was universal so i was able to use it in every page after fixing it.

the next few commits are generally self explanatory like more done home which was me fixing the errors and general design of the page + nav bar.
i had quite a few issues when it came to the sliding-swiper as it simply would not work for me as well as getting the gradient to work, so i decided to simply not constantly do git commits as it would be a waste to document every 4 steps, as it took me quite a long time to get it fully sorted so thats why i only committed it after feeling happy enough with history.html.

the visit.html was the bane of my existence, i had it more or less prepared for writing on the 5th of march, however after being puzzled about the wording in the brief, i sent an email out to the lecturer asking about the styling, which then my previously bootstrap widgets of blog cards shaped in a 7/12 middle then 5/12 outer margin was shut down on the 6th of march at 2pm when the lecturer responded with precisely the answer i didnt want. 
Hence needed to scrap the whole system and use bootstrap grid for the 7/12 left column and 5/12 right column, which in my opinion is rather quite, not "creative content" due to looking not good. 
nor is the index.html as that seems to be quite an outdated thing, e.g. youtube doesnt take you to an separate page after clicking on it, though again from the email it was a bit down to interpretation, as such i made the index as i thought would make most sense. 
another style issue is the 7:5 ratio design, unless im just artistically blind( which i highly doubt with getting all A in school art every year) the web design is just, ugly? when comparing the visit.html site to other travel website they all have it in blog cards like the image below which seems to be the general standard when displaying multiple locations and giving a brief description.  
so the solution would to just have it be in any layout which would look nicer. 
maybe i just interpreted the brief and email entirely wrong, even when consulting with another friend on the topic, but that doesnt matter.

final git commits would be final checks like typos and whatnot, possible final sources.


# on to the actual important parts. 
why such a purple? it looks ugly.
i know it does, however the "Scottish Episcopal Church (Diocese of Brechin) Flag" has a slightly brighter purple, but that looked even worse, so i kept it a slightly darker purple, i could probably make the whole banner be the flag but that would just look tacky.
the nav section works and doesnt need to be commented much as it does what its meant to do, it was originally on the right side, but then looking at other websites for reference i noticed most have the nav stuff on the left side, not right. so design wise it looks a bit better and works better for bootstrap nav.
as mentioned previously the 7:5 ratio was covered, as was the challenges. the general layout was made to "mimic" a boring travel sight at first but later on i started doing my own things with it.
my only real issue is the mobile view for visit.html as its just not a nice sight, depending on how much it annoys me, i might try fix it, but otherwise its not crucial.
i also noticed that bootstrap just doesnt work on safari, not sure why, perhaps it was the website i used to emulate it just didnt like it? to fix it i would probably have to put in somehow a safety net that only shows up on safari however i just dont know how to do that.
